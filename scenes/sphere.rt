ambient (A): Calculate the ambient light component by multiplying the ambient light color by its intensity. Ambient light is a constant light that uniformly illuminates the entire scene.
light_dir (L): direction from the hit point on the sphere to the light source, normalized to a unit vector.

That discriminant value is the key. If itâ€™s negative, then the ray misses and no
intersections occur between the sphere and the ray.
